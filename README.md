# README Generator

This is a program that creates a professional README in an HTML file that is created entirely from Node.js. Answer the series of prompts, and your README will be generated automatically!

-   I wanted to create a nice looking README generator that was very user-friendly
-   I built this project to streamline the sometimes tedious task of creating a README for a project
-   It saves tons of time for the developer!
-   I learned how to use Node.js to create a series of files
    -   Learning how to apply CSS properties was a particular challenge
    -   Also learning how to apply JavaScript functions was a challenge

## Installation

It is required to install Node.js to your machine to run this program. Here is how to do it:

#### For MacOS

```bash
brew install node
```

#### For Windows

```bash
scoop install nodejs
```

#### For Linux

```bash
apk add nodejs npm
```

Next, copy my application by going [here](https://github.com/dsatpm/readme_app).

-   Click on the green 'Code' icon and copy the URL _or_ SSH Key. Information on how to do that can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
-   Once cloned, open 'readme_app' in your IDE of choice (I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
